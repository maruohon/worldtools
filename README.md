Item Scroller
==============
Item Scroller is a tiny mod for Minecraft 1.8.9+, which adds the functionality of moving items in inventory GUIs
by scrolling the mouse wheel over slots with items in them.
This is basically what NEI does/did (and Mouse Tweaks also seems to do), but separated into this tiny mod,
and probably implemented in a different manner.
